The financial impact of different types of disasters significantly shapes the economic and social landscape of affected communities. Natural disasters such as floods, hurricanes, earthquakes, and wildfires, as well as man-made crises like pandemics, can lead to substantial economic losses, affecting both individual households and broader economic structures. Flooding, recognized as the most common and costly natural disaster in the United States, can cause severe damage even in low-risk areas, with a single inch of water capable of resulting in damages amounting to $25,000 for a typical household.\[[1](https://www.fema.gov/sites/default/files/2020-11/fema_protect-your-home_flooding.pdf?id=39a6b699-e8a1-4282-ad4e-e2e49616b038#page=2)\]\[[2](https://www.fema.gov/sites/default/files/2020-10/fema_scenario_4_hurricane_flood_TTX_answer_key-01102020.pdf?id=9d85aab3-7090-4758-addb-ba0ec3d35aba#page=2)\] Hurricanes add to this burden, primarily through storm surges that can cause extensive inland flooding and property destruction.\[[3](https://www.fema.gov/sites/default/files/2020-10/fema_scenario_4_hurricane_flood_TTX_answer_key-01102020.pdf?id=34792ea0-cc26-4e32-af4e-5ecb680515e5#page=2)\]
The financial repercussions of disasters extend beyond immediate property damage. They often disrupt critical infrastructure, including communication networks and power supplies, thereby compounding recovery challenges and prolonging economic strain. Earthquakes, although less predictable, can inflict massive structural damage and necessitate expensive rebuilding efforts, while wildfires destroy homes, businesses, and natural resources, leading to long-term economic instability.\[[4](https://www.fema.gov/sites/default/files/2020-10/fema_scenario_8_earthquake_answer_key_01102020.pdf?id=8b7e190b-8fec-4126-83cb-80b15f727e91#page=1)\]\[[5](https://www.fema.gov/sites/default/files/2020-10/fema_scenario_8_earthquake_answer_key_01102020.pdf?id=c09caaae-ec9d-4302-8a81-3e9b5fcac8fc#page=1)\]\[[6](https://www.fema.gov/sites/default/files/2020-11/fema_protect-your-property_wildfire.pdf?id=67452a1a-b55f-4cf9-b374-161365620d5c#page=3)\] These events underscore the importance of preparedness, risk management, and insurance, yet many individuals and businesses remain underinsured, leaving them vulnerable to catastrophic financial losses.\[[7](https://www.fema.gov/sites/default/files/2020-10/fema_scenario_4_hurricane_flood_TTX_answer_key-01102020.pdf?id=8d1e8dce-48b6-444c-9e48-badd846370e4#page=2)\]
Communities face diverse financial challenges based on the type and severity of the disaster. For instance, urban areas with poor drainage systems are particularly susceptible to flooding, while regions prone to dry conditions are at higher risk of wildfires. In addition, pandemics like influenza do not directly damage physical structures but disrupt economic activities and strain healthcare systems, highlighting the varied nature of disaster impacts.\[[8](https://www.fema.gov/sites/default/files/2020-10/fema_scenario_8_earthquake_01102020.pdf?id=5f0d3a96-3e91-4011-8e93-ac2aa100ee8b#page=1)\]\[[9](https://www.ready.gov/sites/default/files/2020-03/ready_document-and-insure-your-property.pdf?id=1e8c300a-9602-4e59-bf74-88ece065fc2b#page=1)\] Preparedness strategies, including adequate insurance coverage and comprehensive documentation, are vital to mitigate these financial impacts and ensure resilience.
Prominent controversies often revolve around the adequacy of government assistance and the effectiveness of insurance coverage in disaster-prone areas. Federal disaster assistance is frequently contingent upon declarations, and its scope is sometimes criticized as insufficient, leading to debates about the role of private insurance and government programs in disaster recovery.\[[10](https://www.fema.gov/sites/default/files/2020-10/fema_scenario_12_small_business_01102020.pdf?id=7e9431a1-aa26-4da1-819a-21eb418db138#page=1)\] By addressing these challenges through effective mitigation and adaptation strategies, communities can better prepare for and recover from the diverse financial impacts of disasters.\[[11](https://www.ready.gov/sites/default/files/2020-03/ready_document-and-insure-your-property.pdf?id=303f8a57-42ad-4698-add9-d35b3fc890d6#page=3)\]

# Types of Disasters

Natural disasters can have a significant financial impact on communities, and their effects vary depending on the type of disaster. Flooding is the most common and costly natural disaster in the United States, causing extensive damage to properties and infrastructure. Even a small amount of floodwater, such as an inch, can result in approximately $25,000 in damages to a home\[[1](https://www.fema.gov/sites/default/files/2020-11/fema_protect-your-home_flooding.pdf?id=39a6b699-e8a1-4282-ad4e-e2e49616b038#page=2)\]. Floods can occur anywhere and are not limited to high-risk areas, with more than 20 percent of flood insurance claims coming from outside these zones\[[2](https://www.fema.gov/sites/default/files/2020-10/fema_scenario_4_hurricane_flood_TTX_answer_key-01102020.pdf?id=9d85aab3-7090-4758-addb-ba0ec3d35aba#page=2)\]. The causes of flooding include heavy rainfall, poor drainage in low-lying areas, and coastal storms\[[2](https://www.fema.gov/sites/default/files/2020-10/fema_scenario_4_hurricane_flood_TTX_answer_key-01102020.pdf?id=9d85aab3-7090-4758-addb-ba0ec3d35aba#page=2)\].
Hurricanes are another type of disaster that can have devastating financial impacts. These storms can affect areas over 100 miles inland and are particularly active from May 15 to November 30, with the highest activity typically in September\[[3](https://www.fema.gov/sites/default/files/2020-10/fema_scenario_4_hurricane_flood_TTX_answer_key-01102020.pdf?id=34792ea0-cc26-4e32-af4e-5ecb680515e5#page=2)\]. The primary cause of fatalities in hurricanes is storm surges, which can push over 20 feet of water toward the shore and several miles inland, causing extreme flood damage and substantial financial losses\[[3](https://www.fema.gov/sites/default/files/2020-10/fema_scenario_4_hurricane_flood_TTX_answer_key-01102020.pdf?id=34792ea0-cc26-4e32-af4e-5ecb680515e5#page=2)\].
Earthquakes present another significant risk, though the probability and impact can vary by region. Earthquake preparation is crucial, as the shaking can lead to structural damage, loss of life, and widespread economic impacts. The strategy of "Drop, Cover, and Hold On!" is recommended to minimize injuries during an earthquake\[[4](https://www.fema.gov/sites/default/files/2020-10/fema_scenario_8_earthquake_answer_key_01102020.pdf?id=8b7e190b-8fec-4126-83cb-80b15f727e91#page=1)\]. Following an earthquake, communication networks and electricity may be disrupted, adding to the complexity of the financial and social recovery efforts\[[5](https://www.fema.gov/sites/default/files/2020-10/fema_scenario_8_earthquake_answer_key_01102020.pdf?id=c09caaae-ec9d-4302-8a81-3e9b5fcac8fc#page=1)\].
Wildfires also pose a serious financial threat, particularly in areas prone to dry conditions. They can dramatically alter terrain, destroy homes and businesses, and disrupt local economies\[[6](https://www.fema.gov/sites/default/files/2020-11/fema_protect-your-property_wildfire.pdf?id=67452a1a-b55f-4cf9-b374-161365620d5c#page=3)\]. While it's impossible to prevent all wildfires, mitigation strategies can help secure properties and reduce potential losses\[[6](https://www.fema.gov/sites/default/files/2020-11/fema_protect-your-property_wildfire.pdf?id=67452a1a-b55f-4cf9-b374-161365620d5c#page=3)\].
Each type of disaster presents unique challenges and financial implications for communities, highlighting the importance of preparedness and risk management to mitigate these impacts\[[7](https://www.fema.gov/sites/default/files/2020-10/fema_scenario_4_hurricane_flood_TTX_answer_key-01102020.pdf?id=8d1e8dce-48b6-444c-9e48-badd846370e4#page=2)\]\[[8](https://www.fema.gov/sites/default/files/2020-10/fema_scenario_8_earthquake_01102020.pdf?id=5f0d3a96-3e91-4011-8e93-ac2aa100ee8b#page=1)\].

# Financial Impact of Disasters

Natural disasters, such as floods, earthquakes, and hurricanes, have profound financial impacts on communities. Flooding is the most common and costly natural disaster in the United States, with even an inch of water potentially causing $25,000 in damage to a home\[[2](https://www.fema.gov/sites/default/files/2020-10/fema_scenario_4_hurricane_flood_TTX_answer_key-01102020.pdf?id=9d85aab3-7090-4758-addb-ba0ec3d35aba#page=2)\]\[[1](https://www.fema.gov/sites/default/files/2020-11/fema_protect-your-home_flooding.pdf?id=39a6b699-e8a1-4282-ad4e-e2e49616b038#page=2)\]. The costs associated with floods are not limited to high-risk areas, as more than 20 percent of flood insurance claims come from outside mapped floodplains\[[2](https://www.fema.gov/sites/default/files/2020-10/fema_scenario_4_hurricane_flood_TTX_answer_key-01102020.pdf?id=9d85aab3-7090-4758-addb-ba0ec3d35aba#page=2)\].
The financial aftermath of a disaster can strain personal and community resources. Federal disaster assistance, often in the form of low-interest loans that require repayment, may be limited or unavailable unless a presidential disaster declaration is made\[[2](https://www.fema.gov/sites/default/files/2020-10/fema_scenario_4_hurricane_flood_TTX_answer_key-01102020.pdf?id=9d85aab3-7090-4758-addb-ba0ec3d35aba#page=2)\]. Homeowners are encouraged to document their property and ensure they have appropriate insurance to cover potential losses from various perils\[[9](https://www.ready.gov/sites/default/files/2020-03/ready_document-and-insure-your-property.pdf?id=1e8c300a-9602-4e59-bf74-88ece065fc2b#page=1)\]. More than half of all U.S. homeowners, however, do not carry adequate insurance to replace their home and contents in the event of a catastrophic loss\[[9](https://www.ready.gov/sites/default/files/2020-03/ready_document-and-insure-your-property.pdf?id=1e8c300a-9602-4e59-bf74-88ece065fc2b#page=1)\].
In urban areas, the financial toll of disasters is exacerbated by poor drainage and extensive impervious cover, which can lead to severe flooding even from heavy rainfall\[[2](https://www.fema.gov/sites/default/files/2020-10/fema_scenario_4_hurricane_flood_TTX_answer_key-01102020.pdf?id=9d85aab3-7090-4758-addb-ba0ec3d35aba#page=2)\]. Furthermore, disasters can disrupt communication networks and power supplies, compounding the challenges faced by affected communities\[[5](https://www.fema.gov/sites/default/files/2020-10/fema_scenario_8_earthquake_answer_key_01102020.pdf?id=c09caaae-ec9d-4302-8a81-3e9b5fcac8fc#page=1)\].
For businesses, disasters can disrupt operations and lead to significant financial losses. Essential services, such as maintaining frozen food storage or processing payments, can be critically affected\[[10](https://www.fema.gov/sites/default/files/2020-10/fema_scenario_12_small_business_01102020.pdf?id=7e9431a1-aa26-4da1-819a-21eb418db138#page=1)\]. Business owners are advised to prepare by securing adequate insurance coverage and maintaining electronic backups of critical records to ensure a swift recovery\[[10](https://www.fema.gov/sites/default/files/2020-10/fema_scenario_12_small_business_01102020.pdf?id=7e9431a1-aa26-4da1-819a-21eb418db138#page=1)\]\[[11](https://www.ready.gov/sites/default/files/2020-03/ready_document-and-insure-your-property.pdf?id=303f8a57-42ad-4698-add9-d35b3fc890d6#page=3)\]. Various types of insurance, including flood insurance through the National Flood Insurance Program, are available to help businesses mitigate financial risks\[[12](https://www.ready.gov/sites/default/files/2020-03/ready_document-and-insure-your-property.pdf?id=62d6ac8d-f92d-4f92-bbce-0d08fe618256#page=4)\]\[[11](https://www.ready.gov/sites/default/files/2020-03/ready_document-and-insure-your-property.pdf?id=303f8a57-42ad-4698-add9-d35b3fc890d6#page=3)\].

# Comparison of Financial Impacts

Natural and man-made disasters can have significant financial impacts on communities, with each type of disaster presenting unique challenges and costs. Flooding, for example, is the most common and costly natural disaster in the United States. It can occur anywhere and just an inch of water can result in damages amounting to $25,000 for a household\[[2](https://www.fema.gov/sites/default/files/2020-10/fema_scenario_4_hurricane_flood_TTX_answer_key-01102020.pdf?id=9d85aab3-7090-4758-addb-ba0ec3d35aba#page=2)\]\[[1](https://www.fema.gov/sites/default/files/2020-11/fema_protect-your-home_flooding.pdf?id=39a6b699-e8a1-4282-ad4e-e2e49616b038#page=2)\]. Coastal storms are a frequent cause of flooding, but heavy rainfall and poor drainage in urban areas also contribute significantly\[[2](https://www.fema.gov/sites/default/files/2020-10/fema_scenario_4_hurricane_flood_TTX_answer_key-01102020.pdf?id=9d85aab3-7090-4758-addb-ba0ec3d35aba#page=2)\].
On the other hand, wildfires, while not as frequent as floods, can dramatically alter the terrain and conditions of affected areas, destroying homes, businesses, and infrastructure\[[6](https://www.fema.gov/sites/default/files/2020-11/fema_protect-your-property_wildfire.pdf?id=67452a1a-b55f-4cf9-b374-161365620d5c#page=3)\]. The financial toll of wildfires extends beyond immediate property damage to include long-term economic impacts on local businesses and agriculture\[[6](https://www.fema.gov/sites/default/files/2020-11/fema_protect-your-property_wildfire.pdf?id=67452a1a-b55f-4cf9-b374-161365620d5c#page=3)\].
Pandemics pose a different type of financial challenge. While not damaging physical structures, pandemics like influenza can severely strain medical infrastructure and lead to widespread economic disruption. The U.S. has experienced only four pandemics in the last century, but they have demonstrated the potential to overwhelm healthcare systems and lead to significant economic losses\[[13](https://www.fema.gov/sites/default/files/2020-10/fema_scenario_9_pandemic_answer_key_01102020.pdf?id=e07bac44-1c73-4b6c-b140-893a12a803a2#page=2)\].
Disasters like these highlight the importance of financial preparedness and insurance. Homeowners and business owners in high-risk areas often face higher insurance costs due to the increased likelihood of perils such as civil unrest or explosions\[[14](https://www.ready.gov/sites/default/files/2020-03/ready_document-and-insure-your-property.pdf?id=a4f37145-1dcf-4937-b758-4e34615059cf#page=3)\]. To mitigate these financial impacts, individuals and businesses are advised to inventory their belongings and maintain comprehensive documentation for insurance and government assistance purposes\[[15](https://www.ready.gov/sites/default/files/2020-03/fema_safeguard-critical-documents-and-valuables.pdf?id=063cd45a-2df9-4edc-aadc-011302b6a2b4#page=2)\]\[[16](http://www.consumerfinance.gov/documents/5430/cfpb_adult-fin-edyour-disaster-checklist.pdf?id=a7f21b71-4051-44db-9e74-e9c1451f5875#page=4)\].
Effective disaster preparedness also involves understanding and planning for specific risks, whether it's evaluating the Base Flood Elevation for flood risks or consulting professionals for property protection against wildfires\[[1](https://www.fema.gov/sites/default/files/2020-11/fema_protect-your-home_flooding.pdf?id=39a6b699-e8a1-4282-ad4e-e2e49616b038#page=2)\]\[[6](https://www.fema.gov/sites/default/files/2020-11/fema_protect-your-property_wildfire.pdf?id=67452a1a-b55f-4cf9-b374-161365620d5c#page=3)\]. By implementing tailored mitigation measures, communities can reduce the financial burden of disasters and improve their resilience\[[17](https://www.fema.gov/sites/default/files/2020-11/fema_protect-your-property_coastal-erosion.pdf?id=81daed3c-ba10-46c3-97e1-b043f5f3bc17#page=4)\].

# Impact on Communities

Natural disasters can have a profound financial impact on communities, affecting both individual households and the broader economic landscape. Flooding is one of the most common and costly natural disasters in the United States, with even a small amount of water capable of causing substantial damage. Just one inch of floodwater can lead to damages amounting to $25,000 for a single home, emphasizing the severe financial strain it imposes on affected communities\[[1](https://www.fema.gov/sites/default/files/2020-11/fema_protect-your-home_flooding.pdf?id=39a6b699-e8a1-4282-ad4e-e2e49616b038#page=2)\]. Floods disrupt daily life, damage infrastructure, and necessitate significant recovery efforts, all of which contribute to a prolonged economic burden.
Wildfires also pose a significant threat to communities, dramatically altering landscapes and destroying homes, businesses, and resources. The immediate impact of a wildfire can devastate entire neighborhoods, leading to costly rebuilding efforts and long-term economic instability\[[6](https://www.fema.gov/sites/default/files/2020-11/fema_protect-your-property_wildfire.pdf?id=67452a1a-b55f-4cf9-b374-161365620d5c#page=3)\]. Additionally, the destruction of natural resources and agriculture affects livelihoods and can lead to increased food prices, exacerbating the financial impact on the community\[[6](https://www.fema.gov/sites/default/files/2020-11/fema_protect-your-property_wildfire.pdf?id=67452a1a-b55f-4cf9-b374-161365620d5c#page=3)\].
Earthquakes, while less frequent, can be equally devastating. They cause instability and damage infrastructure, homes, and businesses, leading to massive reconstruction costs. The disruption in transportation and infrastructure slows economic activity, impacting not just the local economy but also having ripple effects on a regional and national scale\[[18](https://www.fema.gov/sites/default/files/2020-11/fema_protect-your-property_earthquakes.pdf?id=1e6d8fd7-2921-4b18-af89-b2a6b0f60345#page=2)\].
Apart from natural disasters, other threats such as power outages during extreme heat waves or storms also significantly impact communities. These events can lead to increased emergency services costs, disrupt business operations, and affect vulnerable populations, who may require additional care and resources\[[19](https://www.fema.gov/sites/default/files/2020-10/fema_scenario_5_extreme_heat-01102020.pdf?id=631fa898-6828-4dad-ba1f-0ec608423f30#page=1)\]. Similarly, hurricanes bring the dual threat of wind damage and flooding, often resulting in substantial economic loss and long recovery periods for affected communities\[[20](https://www.fema.gov/sites/default/files/2020-10/fema_scenario_4-hurricane-01102020.pdf?id=c4c08855-0672-4e3d-84bd-ec211f9153a1#page=1)\].

# Case Studies

## Hurricane and Flood Impact

Hurricanes and floods are among the most devastating natural disasters, causing extensive damage to communities both along the coasts and inland. Flooding is not limited to high-risk areas; more than 20 percent of flood insurance claims come from outside these mapped floodplains, underscoring the widespread financial risk \[[2](https://www.fema.gov/sites/default/files/2020-10/fema_scenario_4_hurricane_flood_TTX_answer_key-01102020.pdf?id=9d85aab3-7090-4758-addb-ba0ec3d35aba#page=2)\]. The financial damage from flooding can be severe, with just an inch of water in a home potentially causing up to $25,000 in damage \[[2](https://www.fema.gov/sites/default/files/2020-10/fema_scenario_4_hurricane_flood_TTX_answer_key-01102020.pdf?id=9d85aab3-7090-4758-addb-ba0ec3d35aba#page=2)\]. Despite the availability of federal disaster assistance, such help is often contingent upon a presidential disaster declaration and primarily comes as low-interest loans that require repayment \[[2](https://www.fema.gov/sites/default/files/2020-10/fema_scenario_4_hurricane_flood_TTX_answer_key-01102020.pdf?id=9d85aab3-7090-4758-addb-ba0ec3d35aba#page=2)\]. The cost of storm surges, a primary cause of fatalities in hurricanes, exacerbates the economic burden by causing extreme flood damage as water is pushed over 20 feet high and several miles inland \[[3](https://www.fema.gov/sites/default/files/2020-10/fema_scenario_4_hurricane_flood_TTX_answer_key-01102020.pdf?id=34792ea0-cc26-4e32-af4e-5ecb680515e5#page=2)\].

## Earthquake Consequences

Earthquakes present a unique set of financial challenges due to the unpredictability and potential for widespread destruction they bring. Earthquakes can cause significant structural damage, leading to expensive repairs or rebuilds, especially in areas not traditionally considered high-risk, emphasizing the need for preparedness across all regions \[[4](https://www.fema.gov/sites/default/files/2020-10/fema_scenario_8_earthquake_answer_key_01102020.pdf?id=8b7e190b-8fec-4126-83cb-80b15f727e91#page=1)\].

## Extreme Heat Events

Extreme heat can impose severe financial impacts on communities through increased energy demand and potential power disruptions, as utility systems struggle to cope with the demand for air conditioning \[[19](https://www.fema.gov/sites/default/files/2020-10/fema_scenario_5_extreme_heat-01102020.pdf?id=631fa898-6828-4dad-ba1f-0ec608423f30#page=1)\]. These events can lead to economic losses not only from the strain on infrastructure but also due to their adverse effects on health and productivity, resulting in increased healthcare costs and reduced workforce efficiency.

## Pandemic Influenza

The financial repercussions of a pandemic influenza extend beyond immediate health care costs to affect the broader economy. These include disruptions to businesses due to absenteeism and the implementation of health measures, resulting in significant losses in productivity \[[22](https://www.fema.gov/sites/default/files/2020-10/fema_scenario_9_pandemic_Influenza_01102020.pdf?id=39f10209-c794-4aff-a86e-d4ba037c49ff#page=1)\]. Moreover, the strain on healthcare systems can lead to increased public and private spending, impacting overall economic stability.
These case studies illustrate the diverse financial impacts different disasters can have on communities, highlighting the importance of preparedness and resilience planning to mitigate these effects.

# Mitigation and Adaptation Strategies

Mitigating and adapting to the financial impacts of various disasters requires strategic planning and community involvement. Effective mitigation strategies involve local, regional, tribal, territorial, and state officials playing a crucial role in protecting property and reducing risk through tailored policies and planning efforts\[[17](https://www.fema.gov/sites/default/files/2020-11/fema_protect-your-property_coastal-erosion.pdf?id=81daed3c-ba10-46c3-97e1-b043f5f3bc17#page=4)\]. For example, coastal erosion mitigation requires consulting with professionals such as floodplain managers and engineers, as well as adhering to local regulations before implementing any protective measures\[[17](https://www.fema.gov/sites/default/files/2020-11/fema_protect-your-property_coastal-erosion.pdf?id=81daed3c-ba10-46c3-97e1-b043f5f3bc17#page=4)\].
In regions prone to earthquakes, the National Earthquake Hazards Reduction Program emphasizes the importance of tailoring mitigation measures to specific properties, recommending consultation with insurance agents and other experts in design and construction for effective adaptation strategies\[[23](https://www.fema.gov/sites/default/files/2020-11/fema_protect-your-property_earthquakes.pdf?id=7c5ef026-e2bb-4bb1-b6c8-fe26261cce41#page=4)\]. Additionally, replacement cost coverage in insurance policies can aid in financial recovery by ensuring that rebuilding and compliance with updated building codes are accounted for\[[24](https://www.ready.gov/sites/default/files/2020-03/ready_document-and-insure-your-property.pdf?id=2bd89747-6193-4df8-83c9-0930b68de3bc#page=4)\].
Financial preparedness is another vital aspect of disaster mitigation and adaptation. This includes maintaining comprehensive documentation of financial and legal obligations, insurance policies, and sources of income, which are essential for requesting assistance from insurance providers and government programs after a disaster\[[15](https://www.ready.gov/sites/default/files/2020-03/fema_safeguard-critical-documents-and-valuables.pdf?id=063cd45a-2df9-4edc-aadc-011302b6a2b4#page=2)\]\[[25](https://www.ready.gov/sites/default/files/2020-03/fema_safeguard-critical-documents-and-valuables.pdf?id=9fe5b77c-7f7d-4112-a2bc-4917214c0e98#page=1)\]. Engaging with the community through volunteer programs like Citizen Corps can also enhance community resilience by promoting education and training to better prepare for various threats\[[26](https://www.fema.gov/sites/default/files/2020-10/fema_scenario_12_small_business_answer_key_01102020.pdf?id=7750388c-cd6c-4e7c-841a-440620f76646#page=1)\].
For businesses, having appropriate insurance coverage for specific perils such as floods, earthquakes, and cyber threats is crucial. Consulting with insurance professionals to tailor coverage to local risks and ensuring that policies cover potential perils can significantly mitigate financial impacts\[[11](https://www.ready.gov/sites/default/files/2020-03/ready_document-and-insure-your-property.pdf?id=303f8a57-42ad-4698-add9-d35b3fc890d6#page=3)\]\[[27](https://www.ready.gov/sites/default/files/2020-03/ready_document-and-insure-your-property.pdf?id=c82caa1e-829e-4e5f-be6c-63a76a63949d#page=4)\]. Furthermore, businesses can participate in tabletop exercises and scenario planning to assess preparedness and improve response strategies\[[28](https://www.fema.gov/sites/default/files/2020-10/fema_scenario_12_small_business_01102020.pdf?id=538b6655-943d-4d5e-87fd-32620deaedb3#page=1)\]\[[29](https://www.fema.gov/sites/default/files/2020-10/fema_scenario_3_wildfire-01102020.pdf?id=dcd76bed-bfd9-4eae-bb92-4243ecc411a8#page=1)\].
